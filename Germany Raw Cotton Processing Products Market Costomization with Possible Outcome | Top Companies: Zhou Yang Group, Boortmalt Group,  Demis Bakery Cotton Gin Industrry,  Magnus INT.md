<strong>According to a recently published analytical study titled ""Global Raw Cotton Processing Products Market Industry Analysis, Comprehensive Forecast, and Opportunities Assessment (2025–2033),"" the report provides an in-depth evaluation of market trends, growth opportunities, and projections.</strong>

The ginning (removing lint from seed) process of raw cotton results in the production of cotton fiber, linters and cottonseed. Cottonseed is further processed which results in the production of cottonseed oil, cottonseed hulls, and cotton meal/cake. After the cotton is harvested the primary processing is ginning to separate the lint from the seed. Most of the ginning is done where it is actually cultivated. Raw cotton rarely gets into international trade. The by products of cotton ginning are cottonseed and linters. Linters are used in the manufacturing of rocket propulsion or explosives as these are high in cellulose content. Cottonseed is directly crushed to yield cottonseed oil and cottonseed cake. This cake is un-decorticated cake and is used as cattle feed. Cottonseed is also hulled before it is crushed and solvent extracted, resulting in the production of high pro cotton meal and cottonseed oil. Among the by products linters exports and imports can be under govt. control as it has strategic value. Other by products are mostly domestically consumed and quantum of which coming in international trade is low. Cotton lint is highly traded internationally.
